# England Infrastructure Healthcare and Road Accident Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies data engineering and analytics techniques, including ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Data Warehousing, OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), Reporting, and Data Mining, to analyze infrastructure and development in England. The focus is on healthcare infrastructure and road accidents, examining their impact on public health and safety.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, we aim to:

1. **Analyze Healthcare Infrastructure & Road Accidents**: Investigate the relationship between healthcare facilities and accident occurrences across different regions in England.
2. **Design a Data Warehouse**: Implement a structured data warehouse with at least two data marts to support multidimensional analysis.
3. **Apply Data Mining Techniques**: Utilize clustering, classification, and anomaly detection to extract valuable insights.
4. **Develop OLAP Cubes**: Enable interactive data exploration and trend identification.
5. **Create a Power BI Dashboard**: Provide interactive visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🗂️ Data Collection

- Data sources include open government portals and public datasets.
- Methods: APIs, web scraping, and raw data extraction.
- Geographic components are incorporated for spatial analysis.

## 🏛️ Data Modeling

- **Data Warehouse**: Designed with at least two data marts (e.g., Healthcare and Road Safety).
- **Star Schemas**: Used to structure analytical queries efficiently.

## 📊 OLAP Cube Development

- Built OLAP cubes for multidimensional analysis.
- Allows slicing and dicing data for deeper insights.

## 🔍 Data Mining Techniques

- **Clustering**: Identified regions with similar healthcare access and accident rates.
- **Classification**: Predicted accident severity based on healthcare facility availability.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Analyzed relationships between infrastructure presence and accident frequency.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracked trends in accident occurrences over time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Highlighted regions with unexpectedly high accident rates despite good healthcare infrastructure.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

### Features:

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Maps, charts, and KPIs to explore healthcare and accident data.
- **Filters & Drill-Downs**: Users can filter by region, time period, and accident severity.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Regional disparities in healthcare facilities.
  - Correlation between hospital proximity and accident recovery rates.
  - Trends in accident occurrences based on time, location, and infrastructure quality.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **ETL**: Python, SQL, Apache Airflow
- **Data Warehouse**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **OLAP**: Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
- **Data Mining**: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Power BI
